> This book will also offer some ideas about how Socratic teachings relate to our current cultural and political difficulties.  Let us backtrack a moment.  The ancient Romans built elaborate networks of pipes to deliver water where they wanted it to go.  The networks were a marvel.  But many of the pipes we made of lead, and the water carried the lead along with it.  One school of thought regards this as part of the reason for the decline and fall of Rome: lead poisoning gradually took its toll, impairing the thought and judgement of many Romans, especially at the top.  The theory is much disputed; perhaps it contains no truth.  But as a metaphor it is irresistible.  We have built networks for the delivery of information -- the internet, and especially social media.  These networks, too, are a marvel.  But they also carry a kind of poison with them.  The mind fed from those sources learns to subsist happily on quick reactions, easy certainties, one-liners, and rage.  It craves confirmation and resents contradiction.  Attention spans collapse; imbecility propagates, then seems normal, then is celebrated.  The capacity for rational discourse between people who disagree gradually rots.  I have a good deal more confidence in the lead-pipe theory of the internet, and its effect on our culture, than in the lead-pipe theory of the fall of Rome.

## 1. The Socratic Problem

* **Question:** What is the Socractic Problem?

* **Answer:** No one knows who Socrates is.  When Socrates is referred to, we don't know if it is the literal man himself or an aggregation of Plato's imagination and memory of Socrates.

The end-goal is to understand a style of thought, ie. the Socratic method.  So it's irrelevant to strictly identify who Socrates is in each context.  Instead we can focus on how Socrates thought.
