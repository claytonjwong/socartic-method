> This book will also offer some ideas about how Socratic teachings relate to our current cultural and political difficulties.  Let us backtrack a moment.  The ancient Romans built elaborate networks of pipes to deliver water where they wanted it to go.  The networks were a marvel.  But many of the pipes we made of lead, and the water carried the lead along with it.  One school of thought regards this as part of the reason for the decline and fall of Rome: lead poisoning gradually took its toll, impairing the thought and judgement of many Romans, especially at the top.  The theory is much disputed; perhaps it contains no truth.  But as a metaphor it is irresistible.  We have built networks for the delivery of information -- the internet, and especially social media.  These networks, too, are a marvel.  But they also carry a kind of poison with them.  The mind fed from those sources learns to subsist happily on quick reactions, easy certainties, one-liners, and rage.  It craves confirmation and resents contradiction.  Attention spans collapse; imbecility propagates, then seems normal, then is celebrated.  The capacity for rational discourse between people who disagree gradually rots.  I have a good deal more confidence in the lead-pipe theory of the internet, and its effect on our culture, than in the lead-pipe theory of the fall of Rome.

## 1. The Socratic Problem

#### What is the Socractic Problem?

No one knows who Socrates is.  When Socrates is referred to, we don't know if it is the literal man himself or an aggregation of Plato's imagination and memory of Socrates.

The end-goal is to understand a style of thought, ie. the Socratic method.  So it's irrelevant to strictly identify who Socrates is in each context.  Instead we can focus on how Socrates thought.


## 2. Method vs. Doctrine

#### What is the purpose of the Socractic method?

The unexamined life is *not* livable.  The mind left to itself (intellectus sibi permissus) is automatic, irrational, confused, and error prone.  The Socratic method is a manual, corrective thought process.

#### Plato's two types of teachings:

1. Practical lessons with specific conclusions
2. The Socratic thinking process (the focus of this book)


## 3. Elements of the Method

#### What are the elements of the Socractic method?

1. Question and answer, open-ended dialogue seeking truth
2. Consistency via counter-examples to previous thoughts
3. Identify the underlying principles behind the thoughts
4. Common, concrete examples to illustrate ideas via imagination and analogy
5. Socrates does *not* claim expertise, he confesses his own ignorance

#### Oversimplified Socratic method:

* Ask questions about a claim and look for inconsistent answers
  * What does the claim mean?
  * What else does the claim holder believe?
* Show with follow up questions that the initial claim is contradicted or unsatisfactory
  * Artful denial does *not* sound like an argument
* The initial claim is then modified, and we start over again seeking truth

#### Socratic View

> In the natural process of growth in the human mind, belief does not follow proof, but springs up apart from and independent of it;  an immature intelligence believes first, and proves (if indeed it ever seeks proof) afterwards.
>
[-George Grote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Grote)

Denying what someone claims is an act of friendship.  As a result we may change our mind for the better, or we may improve our understanding of why we think the way we do.  We then become more humble and aware of our own ignorance; less likely to be absolutely certain of our internal "truths" and more open to understanding viewpoints of others.

Good hearted contradictions to hard questions may be best kept to ourselves in the ongoing dialogue within our minds.  It is easier to question others, but more dangerous (Socrates was executed for it).  It is harder to question ourselves and be open to challenging our own beliefs.

We can seek a different kind of comfort.  Rather than concrete answers of absolute certainty, we can be satisfied *without* satisfactory answers while continuing to seek the truth.  The good life is this daily struggle to acquire wisdom.  Claims of truth are easily broken apart; thus we can think and live accordingly.

## 4. The Socratic Function

#### What is the Socractic Function?

Invoking the Socratic method upon ourselves to actively/skeptically question our own beliefs/claims during the daily process of seeking wisdom and truth.

Our mind's process of thinking is an ongoing internal dialogue with ourselves.  Plato displays this in his dialogues as explicit externalization of differing thought processes as metaphorical characters in debate; thus transforming our abstract implicit internalizations into concrete ideas.  This helps self-awareness by portraying our internal Socrates thinking out loud (it separates our sense of self from our thoughts).

## 5. Question and Answer

#### Why a question/answer dialogue?

* Questions are instruments of creative thought
  * Explore hypothetical use cases
  * Refutation/refinement cycle via contradictions
* We can learn from asking questions (not from declaring beliefs/claims/opinions)
* Small incremental questions slow down the thought process (automatic ðŸ‘‰ manual)
* Slow down thought process to increase comprehension of the thought/claim/idea
  * Inspect and dissect thoughts like a connoisseur tastes wine or looks at art
  * The mind's optimal speed is slow and steady (Socrates is never in a rush)

#### Side Effects
  * More intelligent understanding
  * Lose absolute certainty of being correct
  * Lose ability to easily know what to think

## 6. The Elenchus

#### What is the Elenchus?

A constant search cycle for truth via testing, refutation, contradiction, shaming, and ridicule.

1. Make a claim/thought/idea
2. Socrates gets us to agree with another proposition
3. Socrates shows that other proposition is inconsistent with the original claim/thought/idea

We can then modify original claim/thought/idea and repeat the search cycle.

#### Progressive Shame

Socratic questioning forces concessions which are too embarrassing to deny.  We can feel shameful of our mind's inconsistencies.  This is shame within ourselves; a feeling derived from post-processing previously held incorrect beliefs.  It's a sign of progress.

#### Purgative Consequences

> All I'm saying is what I always say: I myself don't know the facts of these matters, but I've never met anyone, include the people here today, who could disagree with what I'm saying and still avoid making himself ridiculous.
>
[-Gorgias (509a)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgias)

The elenchus transforms false certainty of knowledge into more accurate feelings of ignorance.

* Shows we don't believe what we thought we believed
* Shows we don't know what we thought we knew

The elenchus can also be used for [proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction), ie. if the opposite of a postulate `P` is impossible, then it follows that `P` is true.

#### The Art of Falsification

We cannot arrive at truth without identifying fallacies.  After detecting and removing falsehood, truth is what remains.  This occurs after a sufficient amount of refutation/contradiction cycle(s) have been performed, and the conflicting claims/thoughts/ideas have been resolved.  This consistency cleanses dissonance and is evidence of this path's virtue towards truth.  Consistency is a paramount test of truth.  It forces us to lightly hold our beliefs ephemerally as we constantly search for additional confirmation or refutation.

#### Self Examination

The elenchus is a trap we cannot set upon ourselves.  Socrates thinks in advance how to create contradictions.  But we cannot sneak up on ourselves the same way a conversational partner can.  Thus, using the elenchus on ourselves is the search process of contradicting our internal beliefs.  This is hard to do since we have blind spots when viewing ourselves.  It requires a humble acceptance that we are constantly incorrect which makes the search for truth plausible since it detaches us from our false views.  We can get used to being wrong and being wrong more often than we think we are.

## 7. Consistency

> Renouncing the honors at which the world aims, I desire only to know the truth, and to live as well as I can, and, when I die, to die as well as I can.  And, to the utmost of my power, I exhort all other men to do the same.
>
[-Gorgias 526de](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgias)

Internal consistency was paramount for Socrates to live in accordance with nature.  The elenchus allows us to internally debate our own thoughts against each other to acquire internal consistency in the pursuit of truth.

> Socrates is a master of refutation, so it becomes hard to be certain about anything important.  Conclusions that stand unrefuted are provisional; they may *yet* be refuted.  Socrates has a rare combination of beliefs: confidence that truth exists, but humility about whether he knows it.  (Think of how strangely common the reverse has become.)  That is part of why inconsistency matters so much.  It doesn't just show that you are wrong.  It shows that it's possible to *be* wrong.  Philosophy means thinking carefully about whether you believe all that you say and whether it's true.  It is the effort to stay awake.
>
[-Ward Farnsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Farnsworth)

Imagination is necessary for questioning internal beliefs, and internal critique is universally applicable.  This is similar to testing a musical instrument, *not* with an external measuring device, rather with an internal consideration of being in-tune with itself.

Socrates viewed internal inconsistency as a moral sickness to be purged.  We cannot believe two contradicting thoughts without being ignorant (or crazy).  Internal conflict causes practical problems, such as disabling good decision making.

## 8. Systole and Diastole

The Socratic method uses 2 methods of thought: systole and diastole.

1. Systole
  * seeing similarities between things which appear different
  * platonic collection: seeing many as one via categorical "buckets" of similarities
2. Diastole
  * seeing differences between things which appear similar
  * platonic division: seeing one as many via categorical "buckets" of differences

## 9. Analogies

Socrates uses analogies for clarification and refinement of ideas.

1. Fill-in-the-blank
  * Socrates provides a definition of something and asks others in dialog to provide a similar definition for something else
  * Socrates uses these analogies as an example of how to "do it like this"
2. Fill-in-the-blank interrogations
  * Socrates uses this style of questioning as a thought path which starts with simple, familiar things and is guided towards difficult, unfamiliar things, ie. beginning with what is known and attempting to map that information onto what is unknown
  * When someone is having difficulty formulating a sufficient response, show them a proper response in a more familiar universe of discourse which is simple to understand
3. Extended comparisons
  * Socrates compares food for the body and the information we commit to our minds as corresponding food for the mind
4. Argumentative analogies
  * Good tasting food may be bad for your health, while bad tasting medicine may be good for your health

#### Why Analogies?

* To think hard in unfamiliar ways
* Associate abstract ideas with tangible things
  * Taking care of our minds similarly to our bodies

#### What is epagogic reasoning?

Inductive reasoning, ie. using anecdotal evidence derived from specific examples to lead a thought process towards a general conclusion.  The epagoge and analogy work back and forth between the known and unknown as leverage to continually generate and build upon previous ideas.

## 10. Socratic Rules for Dialogue

> There is nothing worse than self-deception - when the deceiver is always at home and always with you.
>
[Cratulus 428d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cratylus)

1. Trying to find truth (dialectic), rather than trying to win a debate (eristic)
2. Examining people, not just claims
3. Judging arguments by merit, regardless who makes them
4. Candor, saying what we think
5. One-witness principle, the partner in dialogue is the judge
  * the crowd is *not* to be trusted
  * personal dialogue
  * insufficient data points: "everybody knows..." or "nobody thinks..."
6. Principle of charity
  * dialogue partners help each provide clarity towards truth
  * consider the best case for your adversarial partner, not the best case for your self-confirming point of view
  * come up with strong objections to our own views
7. Not giving or taking offense
