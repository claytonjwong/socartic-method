> This book will also offer some ideas about how Socratic teachings relate to our current cultural and political difficulties.  Let us backtrack a moment.  The ancient Romans built elaborate networks of pipes to deliver water where they wanted it to go.  The networks were a marvel.  But many of the pipes we made of lead, and the water carried the lead along with it.  One school of thought regards this as part of the reason for the decline and fall of Rome: lead poisoning gradually took its toll, impairing the thought and judgement of many Romans, especially at the top.  The theory is much disputed; perhaps it contains no truth.  But as a metaphor it is irresistible.  We have built networks for the delivery of information -- the internet, and especially social media.  These networks, too, are a marvel.  But they also carry a kind of poison with them.  The mind fed from those sources learns to subsist happily on quick reactions, easy certainties, one-liners, and rage.  It craves confirmation and resents contradiction.  Attention spans collapse; imbecility propagates, then seems normal, then is celebrated.  The capacity for rational discourse between people who disagree gradually rots.  I have a good deal more confidence in the lead-pipe theory of the internet, and its effect on our culture, than in the lead-pipe theory of the fall of Rome.

## 1. The Socratic Problem

* **Question:** What is the Socractic Problem?

* **Answer:** No one knows who Socrates is.  When Socrates is referred to, we don't know if it is the literal man himself or an aggregation of Plato's imagination and memory of Socrates.

The end-goal is to understand a style of thought, ie. the Socratic method.  So it's irrelevant to strictly identify who Socrates is in each context.  Instead we can focus on how Socrates thought.


## 2. Method vs. Doctrine

* **Question:** What is the purpose of the Socractic method?

* **Answer:** The unexamined life is not livable.  The mind left to itself (intellectus sibi permissus) is automatic, irrational, confused, and error prone.  The Socratic method is a manual, corrective thought process.

#### Plato's two types of teachings:

1. Practical lessons with specific conclusions
2. The Socratic thinking process


## 3. Elements of the Method

* **Question:** What are the elements of the Socractic method?

* **Answer:**

1. Question and answer, open-ended dialogue seeking truth
2. Consistency via counter-examples to previous thoughts
3. Identify the underlying principles behind the thoughts
4. Common, concrete examples to illustrate ideas via imagination and analogy
5. Socrates does *not* claim expertise, he confesses his own ignorance

#### Oversimplified Socratic method:

* Ask questions about a claim and look for inconsistent answers
  * What does the claim mean?
  * What else does the claim holder believe?
* Show with follow up questions that the initial claim is contradicted or unsatisfactory
  * Artful denial does *not* sound like an argument
* The initial claim is then modified, and we start over again seeking truth

#### Socratic View

> In the natural process of growth in the human mind, belief does not follow proof, but springs up apart from and independent of it;  an immature intelligence believes first, and proves (if indeed it ever seeks proof) afterwards.
>
[-George Grote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Grote)

Denying what someone claims is an act of friendship.  As a result we may change our mind for the better, or we may improve our understanding of why we think the way we do.  We then become more humble and aware of our own ignorance; less likely to be absolutely certain of our internal "truths" and more open to understanding viewpoints of others.

Good hearted contradictions to hard questions may be best kept to ourselves in the ongoing dialogue within our minds.  It is easier to question others, but more dangerous (Socrates was executed for it).  It is harder to question ourselves and be open to challenging our own beliefs.

We can seek a different kind of comfort.  Rather than concrete answers of absolute certainty, we can be satisfied *without* satisfactory answers while continuing to seek the truth.  The good life is this daily struggle to acquire wisdom.  Claims of truth are easily broken apart; thus we can think and live accordingly.
